# About me 

I have a Bachelor´s degree in Biotechnology. I graduated from the School of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences of The National University of Rosario-Argentina in 2017. My thesis was about the possible biorheological alterations in the microcirculation produced by newborn larvae of Trichinella spiralis.
Among my many passions are learning and teaching Natural Sciences, especially, at any of the branches of Biology and Chemistry.
After obtaining my degree, I did an internship where I had the opportunity of working with a research team who were studying possible antagonistic effects of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) as an inoculant against phytopathogens. Having had this experience has provided me with deep knowledge in the field of plant microbiology. It also allowed me to improve on basic microbiology laboratory techniques such as aseptic and culturing techniques, as well as performing conventional, fluorescent, and confocal microscopy.
Now as a Ph.D. student at The National University of San Martin in Buenos Aires I find myself very interested and very excited to work in the field of Biochemistry of Proteins and Molecular Biology. I am currently working on the expression and purification of recombinant proteins, most of them Intrinsically Unstructured Proteins (IUPs) which could be used as potential antigens for the development of serological tests for Chagas Disease.
