# About me
I am currently finishing my bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology at the University of San Martín (UNSAM). 
I’m doing a graduate thesis in the “Instituto de Investigaciones Biotecnológicas” (IIB) at the “Universidad de San Martín” (UNSAM), which involves high-throughput analysis of peptide arrays to screen antigenic markers in different treatments of Chagas Disease.
